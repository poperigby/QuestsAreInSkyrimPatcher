# QuestsAreInSkyrimPatcher

Synthesis patcher for [Quests are in Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18416). The patcher forwards the formlist condition that QAIS adds to radiant quests to ensure subsequent quests are only assigned to locations within Skyrim and not mod-added worlds. This patcher is intended to allow QAIS to work alongside other quest mods such as [At Your Own Pace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704) and [Skyrim Realistic Conquering](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26396), which also edit radiant quests, without having to make complex combination patches manually for all affected quests.
